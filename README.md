# Assembly Language Input/Output Example

This is a simple assembly language program designed for a Linux-based system. It demonstrates basic input and output operations using system calls. The program prompts the user to input a message, reads the input, and then prints the entered message as output.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have a Linux-based operating system.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source code.

3. Assemble and link the code using an assembler such as NASM and a linker such as LD. Run the following commands in the terminal:


4. Execute the program by running the following command:


5. The program will prompt you to input a message. Enter your desired message and press Enter.

6. The program will then display the entered message as output.

7. The program will terminate after displaying the output.

## Code Explanation

The code is written in assembly language and consists of three sections: `.data`, `.bss`, and `.text`.

- The `.data` section defines variables such as the prompt message and newline characters.
- The `.bss` section reserves memory space for the user input buffer.
- The `.text` section contains the main program logic.

The code uses system calls to interact with the operating system. It invokes the `write` system call to print the prompt message, the `read` system call to read user input, and the `write` system call again to print the output.
